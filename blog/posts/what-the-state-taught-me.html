            </header>

            <div class="post-content">
                <div class="container container-narrow">

                    <p class="lead">The soldier driving the black SUV said it quietly, almost to himself.</p>

                    <p><em>"Forgive us. We're just doing our duty. Earning a living is hard."</em></p>

                    <p>We were somewhere in Jeddah. I didn't know exactly where — I had a blindfold on. A full team of state security officers had just raided my apartment, documented my belongings, handed my keys to my nephew, put me in chains, and loaded me into this car in the middle of the night.</p>

                    <p>And I told him: <strong>You're forgiven.</strong></p>

                    <p>That was July 23, 2022. I wouldn't see the outside world again for 387 days.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>I want to tell you this story fully, because it matters. Not because I want sympathy — I don't. Not because I'm angry — I'm not, or at least that's not the point. But because what happened to me is a window into something larger than one man's ordeal, and because I've spent three years figuring out what to do with it.</p>

                    <p>I'm a doctor. Or I was, in the way that medicine defined my twenties. I graduated with honors from King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, completed a year's internship, was sent on scholarship to the United States to pursue board certification, then came home when my father was diagnosed with stomach cancer. He asked me to come back. I came back. That's the kind of person I was trying to be.</p>

                    <p>But medicine was never just about medicine for me. Since I was young, my real obsession was bigger: <em>Why are we here? What do the great religions actually say? Why does humanity keep fighting over the same questions — and is there a way out?</em></p>

                    <p>I spent years reading. I sat with scholars, thinkers, artists. I practiced meditation. I traveled. I studied Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Buddhism — not to compare them but to listen to what they were all pointing at. And I arrived at a conviction that still lives in me: <strong>they are pointing at the same thing.</strong> The arguments are about the finger, not the moon.</p>

                    <p>That conviction was not abstract. It was the engine of everything I did.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>In the summer of 2022, I had just completed Hajj — the annual pilgrimage, the most spiritually significant week of my year. I was on leave from my residency in family medicine. I was engaged to be married. I had signed a lease on an apartment, furnished it, completed the official paperwork for marrying a non-Saudi woman. My life was, for the first time in a while, pointing somewhere good.</p>

                    <p>Then I found a profile on Twitter.</p>

                    <p>A man calling himself Rabbi Yaakov Herzog — the "Chief Rabbi of Saudi Arabia" — with photographs of himself walking through Riyadh in full traditional Jewish attire, kippah and all. Posting openly. Publicly. With what appeared to be a legitimate American visa.</p>

                    <p>My reaction wasn't alarm. It was fascination. <em>Here is a man living out the very thing I believe in.</em></p>

                    <p>I reached out. He replied. We agreed to meet.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>We sat for three hours at a café in Jeddah. Yaakov grew up in New York, trained at a conservative Jewish seminary, holds a master's degree from Harvard. He had entered the Kingdom on his American passport multiple times. He had a house in Israel, had served in the Israeli army, and was posting all of this publicly on social media. I saw his visa. His status appeared entirely legal.</p>

                    <p>What I found in him was someone who had done the same journey I had, from the other side. A person who had gone deep into the particulars of his own tradition and arrived at universals. We talked about God, about Abraham, about what it would actually mean for human beings to live without the violence that comes from confusing the map with the territory.</p>

                    <p>He mentioned he wanted to visit Sheikh Mohammed Al-Ghamdi — the former head of the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice, who had extended him an invitation. And then he wanted to make a road trip: Medina, Khaybar, AlUla, Tabuk, NEOM.</p>

                    <p>I offered to drive him. In my orange Jeep Wrangler Rubicon. Because that is exactly the kind of thing I do.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>We spent several days on the road together. I won't narrate every detail here, but the images stay with me.</p>

                    <p>Yaakov at the grave of Mukhayreeq ibn al-Nadheer in Medina — a Jewish companion of the Prophet who gave everything he had to support Islam and was buried among the martyrs of Uhud. A story I hadn't known before. A story that shouldn't have surprised me but did.</p>

                    <p>Yaakov in the valley of AlUla, blowing his shofar between ancient rocks, the sound disappearing into the desert air. Me photographing him, both of us laughing.</p>

                    <p>An overnight stay at a NEOM compound, a meeting with a senior executive, an elaborate buffet overlooking the Red Sea. Normal human things.</p>

                    <p>A dark road at night, heading toward Tabuk, where we noticed a car stopping when we stopped, moving when we moved. I took its plate number with binoculars. We reported it to the police. A patrol confirmed: government intelligence. Doing their job, we were told. We accepted that and drove on.</p>

                    <p>We crossed into Jordan, spent a day at a resort, swam in the Gulf of Aqaba. Yaakov took a taxi toward the Israeli border. I drove home.</p>

                    <p class="pull-quote">"What I did on that road trip was heroic. It should have been recognized. I was following the Quranic instruction: 'Say, O People of the Book, come to a common word between us and you.' I was following the Crown Prince's stated vision of moderate, open Islam. I was following the methodology of Saudi Arabia's own religious envoys who build bridges across faiths."</p>

                    <p>I arrived home after midnight. I showered. I checked Twitter. I started getting ready for bed.</p>

                    <p>The doorbell rang.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>Seven agents. Uniformed and plainclothes. Masked soldiers whose job was to search and document. Professional, rehearsed, efficient. They took my phone, my laptop, my iPad. They photographed everything of value in my apartment. They asked me to hand my keys to a relative. They told me it would be a few hours of questions.</p>

                    <p>I was not afraid. I noticed that about myself clearly. I was <em>amazed.</em> Not at their presence, but at the gap between who I knew myself to be and the machinery that had been deployed against me. Five black SUVs for one doctor who had coffee with a rabbi.</p>

                    <p>I got in the car. They asked me to wear a blindfold. I complied.</p>

                    <p>And that's when the driver said it: <em>Forgive us. Earning a living is hard.</em></p>

                    <p>I forgave him then. I forgive him now. The system that put him in that car and told him who to pick up — that's a different matter.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>Four weeks in solitary confinement. A floor mattress, two thobes, a bar of soap, a Quran.</p>

                    <p>On the third day, something happened that I can only describe accurately: <strong>I surrendered.</strong></p>

                    <p>Not to them. To reality. I accepted, in a way that was total and not performative, that I had lost everything — my freedom, my fiancée, my residency, my career path, my savings, my future as I had imagined it. I accepted that there were no answers coming, no timeline, no explanation. And in that acceptance, something released.</p>

                    <p>I was at peace. Genuinely. Not the peace of resignation or numbness, but the peace of a person who has stopped fighting what is and can finally see clearly.</p>

                    <p>I reviewed the entire Quran in that cell. I prayed five times a day. I slept. I thought. I observed the light changing at the small window. Food came through a slot. I was allowed outside perhaps three times in four weeks.</p>

                    <p>I was, in a strange way, okay.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>The interrogation, when it came, was almost a relief. Interaction after weeks of silence.</p>

                    <p>The investigator opened with the standard performance — firm face, formal posture, implied authority. I answered every question with complete honesty and no fear. Not as a strategy. Just because that's the only mode I have.</p>

                    <p>He could see it. And something shifted in him. The performance dropped. He opened up. We talked like human beings. By the end, he had what he needed, and I had, in some small way, made a connection with a stranger inside a system designed to prevent exactly that.</p>

                    <p>They determined I was not a threat. I was transferred to shared cells.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>Eleven more months. Eight people to a room. Sleeping on floor mattresses. A shared toilet. A camera above us, always on. Phone calls once a week. Family visits once a month, behind a barrier.</p>

                    <p>I read. I prayed. I meditated. At night we watched movies on MBC 2. In the morning, Al Arabiya news. People around me were being charged, tried, sentenced or released. For me: nothing. No charge. No trial. No explanation.</p>

                    <p>But I was not wasted in there. I was studying. The men I shared those rooms with were extraordinary — people whose stories I will tell in time, because they deserve to be told. I was watching how human beings function when all the normal structures are stripped away. What holds. What breaks. What remains.</p>

                    <p>One morning I woke from a vision — the kind you don't question — and I knew I was leaving. Not hoped. <em>Knew.</em></p>

                    <p>Three days later, they called my name and told me to collect my things.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>I was transferred to a regular police detention center and held for 18 more days. They attempted to charge me with "disturbing public opinion." I denied it. The Public Prosecution reviewed the case and dropped it entirely.</p>

                    <p><strong>387 days. Zero charges. Zero convictions. Zero justification.</strong></p>

                    <p>I was released on August 13, 2023.</p>

                    <p>My engagement was over — my fiancée's family had waited as long as they could without knowing if or when I would return. My residency position was terminated — 30 days of unexplained absence triggers automatic removal. The career path I had spent years building, gone. A court judgment had been issued against me in absentia while I was imprisoned, because they had refused to let me attend my own hearings. My assets were frozen. My reputation in my social circle, cracked — people afraid to be associated with someone who had been held by State Security.</p>

                    <p>I returned to my father's house. I eventually went back to work — all 387 days counted as paid leave, salaries returned — and then I resigned. Because I had learned something in that cell that made going back feel impossible.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p>I filed a damages claim against State Security for 252 million Saudi riyals — documented losses across every area of my life: career, marriage, privacy, physical health, family suffering, wasted time, broken trust. The Administrative Court redirected the case to State Security's own internal committee, citing the counter-terrorism law. That committee was legally required to respond within 90 days.</p>

                    <p>It has been over 14 months.</p>

                    <p>I have complained to the Royal Court multiple times. No reply.</p>

                    <p>The system that imprisoned me is also the system responsible for compensating me. And it has decided, through silence, that neither my time nor my suffering has value.</p>

                    <p>I have accepted this too. Not as surrender — as clarity about what I am dealing with.</p>

                    <div class="section-break">· · ·</div>

                    <p class="lead">Here is what I actually learned in 387 days.</p>

                    <p>The world is not failing because of bad people. It's failing because of a structural design problem. The systems we built to organize human life — states, borders, credentials, security apparatuses — were designed to manage populations, not to serve people. They are efficient at control. They are catastrophically bad at human connection.</p>

                    <p>I was imprisoned for doing something simple: treating a human being as a human being regardless of the flag on his passport. The instinct that drove me to reach out to a rabbi, to drive him through my country, to sit with a sheikh and translate between them — that instinct is not special to me. It is basic to every person I have ever known, when they are not afraid.</p>

                    <p>The fear is manufactured. The walls are maintained. And people on both sides pay the cost.</p>

                    <p class="pull-quote">"What we need is not a new ideology. It's new infrastructure for belonging — a system that makes human connection across lines not just possible but normal, trusted, and protected."</p>

                    <p>That is what I am building now.</p>

                    <p>It is called Cosmic League. And the founding story — the proof of why it is necessary — is the 387 days you just read about.</p>

                    <p>I am not building it out of anger. I am building it because I have seen what happens when belonging has no infrastructure to protect it. And I have seen, in a cell with eight strangers who became brothers, what human beings are actually capable of when the performance is stripped away.</p>

                    <p>The world I am building toward is not idealistic. It's just honest about what human beings are, underneath everything that's been put on top of us.</p>

                    <p>That world is coming. Whether the current systems welcome it or not is, as I said from the back of a black SUV in the middle of the night, irrelevant.</p>

                    <p>It is what is true. And what is true prevails.</p>
