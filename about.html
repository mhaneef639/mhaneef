                        <h2>Hello, I'm Mohammed</h2>
                        <p class="lead"> work as a creative systems thinker at the intersection of performance, consciousness, and design. At the core of everything I do is a simple belief: clarity matters. How we live, work, and create depends on how clearly we see ourselves and the systems around us.</p>
                        <p>My path hasn’t been a straight line. I was trained in medicine and spent years inside structured, high-pressure systems. Over time, I felt a growing gap between theory and real human experience. That pushed me to step away and explore how people actually function, physically, mentally, and socially, outside rigid frameworks.

Along the way, I became deeply involved in athletics, creative work, and long-form thinking. I taught myself photography and video as a way to express ideas visually. I trained my body to understand discipline and resilience firsthand. And I kept returning to the same question: what actually helps humans grow in a sustainable and honest way?

Today, my work lives in three areas. I offer advisory work to individuals and organizations around performance, leadership, and decision-making. I do creative work through photography and video, not just as content, but as a way to communicate meaning and identity. And I’m building Cosmic League, a long-term community and venture focused on human potential, connection, and conscious systems.

My approach is practical and reflective. I’m not interested in hype, shortcuts, or motivation for its own sake. I care about structure, responsibility, and alignment over time. What holds up when things get difficult. What actually works in real life.</p>
                        <p>This space is for people who value depth, clarity, and honest work. If you’re here to think clearly, create intentionally, or build something meaningful, you’re welcome here.</p>

                            <p>I began my professional path in medicine, where structure, responsibility, and pressure shaped how I think. That experience gave me discipline and respect for human complexity, while also revealing the limits of rigid systems.</p>
