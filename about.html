        <h2>Hello, I'm Mohammed</h2>
        <p class="lead">I help people find clarity when decisions feel heavy, the noise is high, and the next step isn't obvious.</p>

        <p>My background is unusual by design: I was trained in medicine, spent time inside structured, high-pressure environments, then stepped away to study what works in real life, how people actually perform, decide, and build when stakes are real.</p>

        <p>Over the years I've lived inside multiple systems: institutions, athletics, creative work, and entrepreneurship. Each one teaches you something different about stress, identity, discipline, and meaning.</p>

        <p>That mix is why the work I do is simple: we slow things down, name what's true, make tradeoffs explicit, and choose a direction you can commit to.</p>

        <p>My approach is practical and reflective. I'm not interested in hype or motivation for its own sake. I care about <strong>structure</strong>, <strong>responsibility</strong>, and <strong>alignment over time</strong>, what holds up when things get difficult, and what actually works.</p>
        <p>This space is for people who value depth, clarity, and honest work. If you're here to think clearly, create intentionally, or build something meaningful, you're welcome here.</p>

          <h3>Foundations in Medicine</h3>
          <p>I began my professional path in medicine, where structure, responsibility, and pressure shaped how I think. That experience gave me discipline and respect for human complexity, while also revealing the limits of rigid systems.</p>

          <h3>Exploration and Rebuilding</h3>
          <p>I stepped away to explore how humans actually function beyond theory. Through athletics, creative work, and direct experience, I learned about performance, resilience, and expression in real life.</p>

      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Clarity Over Noise</h3>
        <p>I believe clarity is the foundation of good decisions and meaningful work. When things are clear, energy is focused, effort is honest, and progress becomes sustainable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Responsibility Before Results</h3>
        <p>Growth starts with taking responsibility for how we think, act, and show up. I value long-term alignment over short-term wins, and structure over motivation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="value-card">
        <h3>Experience Over Theory</h3>
        <p>I trust what is tested through real experience. Whether in work, creativity, or life, I believe understanding deepens when ideas are lived, questioned, and refined over time.</p>
